# Assignment 1

## Detecting and Counting Coins

**Goal:** Build an image-processing pipeline that **segments coins** and **estimates how many coins** are present **without using contours or connected components**.  
Students are asked to use the techniques covered in the Labs 1, 2, and 3

**What you will practice:**
- Point operations
- Neighborhood operations
- Histograms
- Thresholding
- Morphological operations

## Lane Edges Detection
**Goal:** Build an edge detection algorithm to detect the lanes and then apply a mask to select the region of interest (ROI), specifically the road itself.
Students are asked to use the techniques covered in the Labs 1, 2, and 3

**What you will practice:**
- noise cancellation
- cany edge detector

**Constraint:** Do **not** use `findContours`, `connectedComponents`,`cv2.Canny`, or similar labeling functions.
